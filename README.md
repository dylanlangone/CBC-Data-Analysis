# CBC-Data-Analysis

This is a high school research project for the detection of CBCs from LIGO data.  Before using please read the my paper entitled "A Search for Astrophysics Sources of Gravitational Waves Using LIGO S6 Data." 

To implement the code, load it into an IDE of your choice or run it as from the command line.  Be sure to maintain an internet connection while running the code for the smoothest results.  The code entitled "MainAnalysis.py" runs through LIGO data and a single template between two specified times and returns an augmented text file containing the times of peak SNRs.  THe code entitled "PlotData.py" creates relevant graphs of data from specified times.
